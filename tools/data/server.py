"""MCP server: historical market-data tools over OpenBB, persisted to a parquet lake.

Three layers, each with one job:
  - this file (server.py) — THIN glue to MCP: one tool per capability
  - feeds.py              — THIN glue to OpenBB: one fetch fn per capability
  - lake.py               — OWNED generic parquet persist/merge/read (kind-agnostic)

A capability tool just wires feed → lake → text. Adding one (another OpenBB endpoint)
is a ``feeds`` fn + a tool here; ``lake.py`` never changes. All tools return trusted,
structured market data (no guardrail).

Tools exposed:
  equity-ingest — fetch equity OHLCV bars and merge them into the lake
  crypto-ingest — fetch crypto OHLCV bars and merge them into the lake
  data-read     — read stored bars back out of the lake (any asset)

    Fetch equity OHLCV bars from Yahoo Finance and persist them to the parquet lake.

    (fetch 2024 today, 2023 tomorrow, keep both). ``interval`` is OpenBB's bar size (1m,
    2m, 5m, 15m, 30m, 60m, 90m, 1h, 1d, 5d, 1W, 1M, 1Q; default 1d). ``start``/``end`` are
    ISO dates (YYYY-MM-DD); omit both for the provider's default window (yfinance: ~1y).
    ``source`` is the OpenBB provider — CHOOSE BY HISTORY DEPTH: use "yfinance" (default,
    free) for daily/weekly/monthly bars, or intraday within roughly the last 30 days. Use
    "tiingo" (needs TIINGO_API_KEY) for intraday bars (1m–1h) older than ~30 days: yfinance
    only retains ~30 days of intraday history and returns nothing beyond it, whereas tiingo
    has years. Pass ``refresh=true`` to replace the stored file instead of merging.
